            <p>Multireligious Spiritual and Cultural Centre – A concept for the present-day European Jerusalem.</p>
            <p>A conceptual design for a multireligious square comprised of 4 places of worship (a Catholic Church, Orthodox Church, Mosque and Synagogue) surrounding a plateau with a central youth-club. The youth-club holds a multifunctional space, fit with a stage, a lower floor endowed with a library and space for an interreligious council.</p>
            <p>Created and conceptualised in response to the current climate of division which permeates both Bosnia and the globe, but also in keeping with the spirit of Sarajevo and Bosnia: as a meeting point of cultures and religions; as model for co-existence.</p>
            <p>Designed by Mimo. Showcased in 2016 at the Academy of Fine Arts, Sarajevo.</p>
